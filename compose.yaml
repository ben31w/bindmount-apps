# Here the instructions define your application as two services called "todo-app" and “todo-database”
# The service “todo-app” is built from the Dockerfile in the /app directory,
# and the service “todo-database” uses the official MongoDB image 
# from Docker Hub - https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo. 
# You can add other services your application may depend on here.

services:
  todo-app:
    build:
      context: ./app
    links:
      - todo-database

    # Mount a local folder "./app" to a container folder "/usr/src/app"
    # However, prevent the bind mount from overwriting "/usr/src/app/node_modules"
    # (this is where packages are installed).

    # This bind mount enables us to make live changes while the app is running.
    # We can edit files in the ./app directory, refresh the page, and because of
    # the mount, the changes are reflected.
    volumes: 
     - ./app:/usr/src/app
     - /usr/src/app/node_modules
    ports:
      - 3001:3001

  todo-database:
